# Review Project

## General info
I created this mini project because I've needed it. And actually I'll leave it as is.
If you want to you can do whatever you desire with all of these files.

## Specs: 
The whole app is as easy as possible. You just click create button and you can write whatever you want to. So I won't tell you how to use it, there are no hidden features, hidden buttons etc.
Just landing page, and two modals. One for watching whole review content, and second one for creating new review.

To use this app, you have to install Node.js and then uses `start.bat`. If you'd like to use it on Linux you should use `node ./server.js` command.

**Warning!**
This app works only locally. Meaning you'll encounter many problems using it outside your host system.
However if you want you can fix it. To do so, you should change the contents of updateData function (change address to whatever your ip address is). Good luck!
